# My Points Compass Devlog (2022)

## 0703

Increased runs to 100 million. The run times over 3 runs are fairly consistent with the recursive version taking about 3 times as long.

### Project Work

Now concentrating on working on a project, following career coach Ben's advice.

I've been wanting to learn React Native. Brainstorming, thought an app inspired by the discontinued Boleskine would be fun. I'd like to make one that would be adaptable to allow the user to choose any location to find the direction of.

Started a new project in Omnifocus, just called 'New Project' till I have an app name. Confirmed Boleskine is still absent from App Store, though it is listed at <https://apprecs.com/ios/1103407698/boleskine>. Downloaded Compass (Pro) from App Store, but it doesn't do what I have in mind. Next, may try to download Boleskine from apprecs.

## 0704

Found Which Way on App Store. You tag a location and it will give an arrow and distance from your tag on watch only. Includes a 'Data Not Collected' rating and 'Family Sharing'. $2.99.

Downloaded the first 3 Qibla-finder apps from the App Store when searching 'Mecca':

| Name | $ | Description |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| Qibla Compass | free, $1.99 to remove ads | Compass face with Qibla icon. |
| Qibla Finder | free, $0.99/mo $4.49/6 mo $6.49/yr to remove ads | Arrow green when facing Qibla. |
| Qibla Pro | free | Background green when facing Qibla. |

Found <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction,_position,_or_indication_sign>. There are lots of places, especially Etsy selling these signs.

Also found:

| Name | $ | Description |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| SignPost - Personal Compass| $1.99 | Arrow points to a significant location with a relevant background image. Only 2 out of five stars. |
| Signpost AR | free | View an augmented reality direction sign in app and take a picture of it in your surroundings. No ratings or reviews shown. |
| Signpost AR Premium | $1.99 | Ability to add and edit locations. |

Of all the apps I found, only SignPost seems really close to what I'm thinking about doing.

Found <https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/can-you-patent-your-mobile-app>, which discusses 'What's new?' and 'the standard of "non-obviousness," which dictates that the product seeking a patent be different enough from similar existing products that a person with average skill and knowledge in the area would not be able to conceive of or make the product themselves easily'. I don't know if would patent my app, but I definitely don't want to be sued. 

## 0705

A search of 'SignPost' at <https://search.uspto.gov/search?affiliate=web-sdmg-uspto.gov&op=Search&page=3&query=SignPost> yielded no relevant result. SignPost and Signpost AR are by different developers. The former is made by <oval.fi> and the App Store link is <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signpost-personal-compass/id1172914663>. Didn't find a Github for Oval. I think I'll be alright since what I want to do is significantly different.

What do I want to call it?

Possibilities:

DirectionSign

Read <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerpost>, which pointed me to this nifty project: <https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2018/01/28/these-signs-at-nasas-jet-propulsion-lab-use-the-deep-space-network-to-point-to-missions-in-real-time/> (the sky's no longer the limit!) and this sculpture: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_(sculpture)>.

Just downloaded the free version of Signpost AR. Impressive! I need to do a lot of thinking about if I still want to pursue my idea. Maybe use conceit of a compass rose or other?

Comparing existing compass apps:

| Name | $ | Ratings | Rating | Description |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compass (built-in) | free | 465 | 3.3 | Open to change to True North, add bearing by tapping its degree. |
| Compass - Professional | IAPs $0.99-$10.99 | 821 | 4.7 | Compass with map in it. Add bearing by 3 formats of lat-long. |
| Compass∞ | IAPs | 3.4k | 4.6 | Bills itself 'The #1 Compass Navigation App'. Lots of bells and whistles I'm not interested in. Shows bearing but can't set it. Free version ad-supported. |
| Compass and GPS | free | 523 | 4.6 | Shows current location name and coordinates. A tap brings up current location on map. |
| Commander Compass Go | IAP subscriptions for extra maps | 6.8k | 4.7 | Military style compass allowing the setting of 'target' by coordinates or map. Incredible work, but maybe too much going on in it for your average civilian. |
| Compass x | IAP | 7k | 4.6 | Looks like an antique compass. |
| The Best Compass | IAPs for all features & no ads $3.49/m, $27.99/y, $39.99/forever | 1.5k | 4.5 | Like what I have in mind but with extra features like weather. Has preset for Mecca, no ability to add other bearings. Ads very intrusive. Measures magnetic field. |
| Compass Simple | IAPs | 5 | 5.0 | No ability to add bearings. Keeps hanging. |
| Compass GPS Map Location | IAPs | 66 | 4.6 | Basic functionality with several accessibility features. |

Continuing to add similar apps to table above.

Looked at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(angle)>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_of_prayer>.

## 0710

Feeling the urge to find a name for the app. Think my basic idea of having a compass the user can add built-in or custom points or bearings to could work. Adding, now, just the names of other compass apps to the above table. Skipped some that were part of toolkit apps or too far off the mark of what I'm doing. Looks like 37 on the table now. It looks like a much-explored domain that must have some demand to support so many versions.

Potential Names:

MyCompass - shared with health and human services and health apps and sites
Custom Compass - already in App Store
My Directions Compass - seems free
My Places Compass - seems free
Compass Rose - shared with another app, Compass Rose Management, on App Store and Compass Rose Simple on Play Store
Compass Star - shared with Compass Rose Mbbile trading apps
My Points Compass - seems free

Let me gestate....

## 0711

Think My Points Compass will work. Can always change later.

Set up the repo <https://github.com/ronsala/my-points-compass> and moved the above devlog portions into it.

Started a `user-stories.md` checklist.
